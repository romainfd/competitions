Running `PROG=nom_prog make all` will create the result directory `results/nom_prog` and fill it with the results of `nom_prog.py` on each input file

## Debrief
- Visualize data
- Be able to assess the quality of a result / what to work on
- Randomizing a simple / stupid solution is good
- Start with easy things !! Likely no exact solution
- Use `name_version.py` to avoid conflicts
